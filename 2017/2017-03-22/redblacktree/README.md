# Exercise

Jan did an introduction about [Red-Black trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree),
and we watched some videos about it:

- [Red Black Tree - Part 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axa2g5oOzCE)
- [Red Black Tree - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhY56LpCtP4)

We discussed among ourselves with a whiteboard how insertions in a Red-Black
tree works, and then looked for existing implementation in Go and set ourselves
to test them and add benchmarks to compare them.
